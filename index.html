      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>My name is Kira Lowrey. I am a student at UCSD Extention. This website is a part of the prepwork for my coding class. It was made on May 18th 2020.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I have lived all over the world, but I have spent the most time in San Diego Califonia.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy playing the piano and singing in choir. I like to read mythology, sci-fi, and fantasy. And love playing videogames like Pokemon and Animal Crossing.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I have a lot of things I want to do in life. Coding is obviously one thing. However I also like working with kids and creative writing.</p>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I think web development is a great combination of STEM and creativity. Learning and following rules (like what to type to make this and that work) is somthing that I find enojoyable, like solving a puzzle that I get to create myself.</p>
